## Course Deliverable
<!-- https://sites.allegheny.edu/registrar/spring-2023-final-exam-schedule/ -->
- Exam code "A"
- Final project Due: Monday, 9 December, 2024

## Course Description

A study of computational methods of data analysis with an emphasis on understanding and reflecting on the social, cultural, and political issues surrounding data and its interrogation. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students study, design, and implement analytics software and learn how to build predictive models with foundational machine learning algorithms to extract knowledge from various sources of data. Students also investigate the biases, discriminatory views, and stereotypes that may be present during the collection and analysis of data, reflecting on the ethical implications of using the resulting machine learning techniques. During a weekly laboratory session, students use Industry-grade open source statistical software to complete projects, reporting on their findings through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. Prerequisite: CMPSC*101 or CMPSC*102. 

## Distribution Requirements

* __PD__: _Power, Privilege, & Difference_. Understanding Power, Privilege, & Difference means understanding the role of power, privilege, prejudice, discrimination, stereotypes, inequity, and oppression in human society, in both historical and contemporary contexts, and recognizing these dynamics in the learner’s own life and communities.

  + __Learning Outcome__: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of the historical and/or contemporary roles of power, privilege, and difference in human society.

* __QR__: _Quantitative Reasoning_. Quantitative Reasoning is the ability to understand, investigate, communicate, and contextualize numerical, symbolic, and graphical information towards the exploration of natural, physical, behavioral, or social phenomena.

  + __Learning Outcome__: Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of how to interpret numeric data and/or their graphical or symbolic representations.

## Course Objectives

Students successfully completing this class will have developed:
+ A “big-picture” view of data science.
+ An understanding of the objectives and limitations of data analytics.
+ An understanding of the main methods in data science for analytical goals.
+ Practical skills using relevant software tools and programming techniques.
+ An understanding of the contemporary roles of power and difference as they relate to the knowledge derived from a data set.
+ An understanding of biases, discrimination and stereotypes that maybe present during collection, analysis, and reflection on the latent trends in real-world data sets.
+ The course is divided into modules, with several of the modules consisting of investigations of real-world data in a specific field. In addition to learning specific technical and programming skills in each module students will be required to read a relevant article and prepare for a discussion related to the issues raised in the article.
+ Students will also enhance their ability to write and present ideas about data analytics in a clear and compelling fashion. Finally, students will gain practical experience in the design, implementation, and analysis of data for research during laboratory sessions and a final project.

## An Ethical Interest

Throughout the semester students will be challenged with serious analytical questions connecting the investigated data and its analysis to arising societal issues of bias, ethical consideration and the culture of power. This step is to ensure that analytics is performed with a lens on the data, as well as its impacts (positive and negative) on culture, community, and society. We note here that there is often no clear indication of a “correct” decision as a result of an analysis of data. The so-called “right” decision ought to be made by analysis who has studied both the data, and the consequences of decision in terms of humanitarian, environmental, ecological and other factors. This class cannot give you the correct decision, however it can help to enable your critical thinking skills which will provide you with some understanding of how to navigate to worthy decisions.

#### Recording Policy (prepared by Campus Life and Community Standards Committee)

In remote teaching and learning contexts, there is an understanding that instructors (including faculty, coaches, staff, and facilitators) have the right to record class and discussion proceedings.  All other participants must request permission of the instructor in advance before making any additional recordings.  An instructor's pre-recorded material, including lectures and class notes, may not be shared with anyone outside of the course's current enrollment without the consent of the instructor. Similarly, under no circumstances may a recording, still, screenshot, picture, or any other media of any sort be altered or circulated by anyone outside of its original intent. No content may be distributed outside the circle of participants without the consent of all who appear or are heard. The college community is reminded of Allegheny College's Recording Policy, outlined in 9.8 of the Faculty Handbook, as well as Allegheny's Statement of Community. Violations will be referred to the Student Conduct system.  Classes may also be recorded if approved as an educational accommodation through the Student Accessibility and Support Services. Faculty are further reminded that recordings of class activities are educational records protected under FERPA. While students do not have a right to be anonymous in a class in which they are enrolled, they have the legal right to be anonymous to third parties. Please direct questions about FERPA to the Registrar.

#### Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Reporting (prepared by the Title IX Coordinator)

Allegheny College is committed to providing a workplace and educational environment that is free from all forms of harassment, discrimination, and sexual misconduct. The College expressly prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, religion, and disability. Allegheny College prohibits sex-based harassment, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and stalking regardless of the gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation of the individuals involved in any education program or activity that it operates, as required by Title IX, including admission and employment.

Allegheny College adheres to all federal, state, and local civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and education. The College does not discriminate in its admissions practices, in its employment practices, or in its educational programs or activities. Allegheny College also prohibits retaliation against any person participating in good faith in any discrimination investigation or complaint process internal or external to the institution; for bringing a complaint of discrimination or harassment or for assisting someone with such a complaint.

Allegheny College is required to respond promptly and effectively, utilizing a fair, transparent, and reliable process, when they have knowledge of conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination in its program, and must take steps to prevent the recurrence of discrimination and remedy its effects, the college must communicate their policies and procedures to all students, employees, and other participants in their programs and must monitor and address barriers to reporting instances of sex discrimination.

Allegheny College employees must notify their Title IX Coordinator when they have information that may reasonably rise to the level of sex discrimination, so long as the employee is not a confidential employee, as defined on page 3 of this policy. All employees must be trained upon hiring and annually thereafter on (i) the College’s obligation to address sex discrimination, (ii) the scope of conduct that constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX, including sex-based harassment, and (iii) all duties of employees upon receipt of a report of sex discrimination, including to provide the reporting individual with contact information for the Title IX Coordinator and information about how to report sex discrimination under Title IX.
